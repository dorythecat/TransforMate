The commands in this category should be the easiest to use, at least at a basic
level. They allow users to transform themselves and others, and are the barrier
of entry to 95% of the many other functions the bot has at your disposal. We
recommend checking out the [Basic TransforMate Tutorial](../../tutorials/basic.md)
to acquire some basic knowledge on the usage of these commands.

Even though you don't have to, we **strongly** recommend you check out the full
documentation on these commands, at least for the /transform command. If you have
to read anything in detail from this entire documentation, let it be this command.
It's the most complex, but also the most versatile.

- [`/transform <user> <into> <image_url> <channel> <brackets> <copy> <merge>`](transform.md)
??? info
    In its most basic form, allows you to transform yourself and other users easily.
    You can also copy other users, or even merge with them, if properly used. For
    those functions, please check either the command's full documentation page or
    the [Basic Twinning Tutorial](../../tutorials/twinning.md).

- [`/goback <user>`](goback.md)
??? info
    Go back to your normal self, or, if you have been transformed
    previously, you'll go back to that form.

- [`/(un)claim [user]`](claim_and_unclaim.md)
??? info
    (Un)claim another user for yourself, ergo making it so you're the only
    one allowed to transform or otherwise modify the user you claim, as if they were
    fully yours.

- [`/safeword`](safeword.md)
??? info
    For those who have been claimed against their will, or think the user that has
    claimed them has overstepped, this command is the one to come to your rescue,
    always there when you need it.

- [`/export_tf <user> <file>`](export_tf.md)
??? info
    When you want to save a tf for later, be it as a file or as a string. It also
    makes transformation way easier to share!

- [`/import_tf <user>`](import_tf.md)
??? info
    Imports a saved tf into either yourself or another user. Very much like a
    very compact /transform.
