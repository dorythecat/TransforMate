TransforMate has a lot of commands. To be able to use all of its functionality,
you will need to have a basic understanding of how the commands work, and how they
are structured both inside the code files, and at a client-side level.

The following pages have been written to list the full plethora of commands contained
in each of the categories, with an example usage listed. For a full description of
the usage and inner workings of a command, click on it to be redirected to its
specific page, with full details.

Remember, command parameters are named in the documentation as they are present in
the code. `<parameter>` means the parameter is optional, and doesn't have to be
provided for all uses. `[parameter]` denotes a parameter that is required, and the
command won't work without it.

- ## [Transformation](transformation/index.md)
  > These commands allow us to transform ourselves and others; and play around with
    those transformations without altering any modifiers. This also includes the
    commands to save and load tf files and strings.

- ## [Roulette](roulette/index.md)
  > These commands allow us to set up and use one (or more, with a Patreon subscription)
    roulettes, which are a way to randomly assign a transformation from a chosen list of
    possibilities.

- ## [Set and Clear](set_and_clear/index.md)
  > These commands allow us to configure, alter, and clear the settings a user has,
    like their speech impediments and alterations, as well as other settings.

  > Get the current status of one or all of the settings of a specific user, as
