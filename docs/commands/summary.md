TransforMate has a lot of commands, and, to be able to use all of its functionality,
you will need to have a basic understanding of how the commands work, and how they
are structured both inside the code files, and at a client-side level.

The following pages have been written to list the full plethora of commands contained
in each of the categories, with an example usage listed. For a full description of
the usage and inner workings of a command, click on it to be redirected to its
specific page, with full details.

Remember, command parameters are named in the documentation as they are present in
the code. `<parameter>` means the parameter is optional, and doesn't have to be
provided for all uses. `[parameter]` denotes a parameter that is required, and the
command won't work without it.

- ## [Transformation](transformation/index.md)

    those transformations, without altering any modifiers. This also includes the
    commands to save and load tf files and srings

- ## [Set](set/index.md)
  > These commands allow us to both configure and alter the settings a user has,
    like their speech impediments and alterations, as well as other settings.
