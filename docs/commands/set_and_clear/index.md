The "set" commands allow you to, as the name implies, set (and modify) almost every
setting a transformed user has. For now, most of these settings, excluding the
biography, are speech modifiers that alter their messages, in one way or another.

The "clear" commands, on the other hand, allow you to clear the settings the user
has, individually or all at once.

!!! warning
    Remember that there's no undo button for these commands; clearing a setting
    will mean that you'll have to set it up again if you decide it was something
    you wanted.

- `/clear all_fields <user>`
??? info
    Clears the entirety of a user's configuration (except claims), effectively
    undoing any previous set commands.
    !!! warning
        We recommend you save a transformation before clearing all the settings of a
        user. That will reduce the chance of you regretting it later.
