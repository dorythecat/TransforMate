This category only contains two commands at the moment. Their purpose is to allow
you to create a blocklist of both users and channels where you really wouldn't
want to be interacting with the bot, at a personal level.

!!! note
    Remember, to unblock a channel or user, you just have to execute the same
    command you executed when you set it up.

- ['/block channel <channel>'](channel.md)
??? info
    Block a specific channel for you personally. Nobody, not even admins, will be
    able to transform you on said channels. If you're transformed on the server,
    it will not show up on blocked channels.

- [`/block user [user]`](user.md)
??? info
    Block a specific user for you personally. They won't be able to interact with
    you on that server.
    !!! warning
        Remember: blocking another user only blocks them in the server you're
        currently on, not on all servers.
    They won't be able to interact with you through the bot in any manner.
