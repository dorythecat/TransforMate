   TransforMate Discord Bot (hereinafter "the Bot"); as well as any related services,
   features, content, or applications offered by the Team (collectively referred to
   as "the Service"), including any web interface for the bot (hereinafter "the Web").

2. By accessing or using the Service in any manner, be it direct or indirect, you
   agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms,
   you must not use the Service.

   under 13, you must not use the Service. If you are between 13 years old and the
   legal age of majority, according to your jurisdiction's civil law, you may only
   use the Service with the consent of a parent or legal guardian, who agrees to be
   bound by these Terms, on your behalf.

4. If you are under the age of sexual consent in your jurisdiction, you may not use
   the Service to engage in physical or digital sexual activities of any nature.

5. If you have been emancipated in your jurisdiction, or otherwise are legally
   considered an adult according to the civil law of your jurisdiction; and as issued
   by an officially endorsed court of law, you will be considered as being above the
   age of legal maturity for the purposes of these Terms, though you will not be
   considered to be above the age of sexual consent. In this manner, paragraph 3 does
   not apply to you, whilst paragraph 4 does still apply.

## 2. Modification of the Terms
1. The Team reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will
   be effective immediately upon posting on the Service or through other communication
   channels. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes
   your acceptance of the new Terms and conditions. It is your responsibility to
   review these Terms periodically for updates.

## 3. User environment
1. The Service is designed to be used in the environment of a Discord server
   (hereinafter "the Server"). The Team is not responsible for the content or behavior
   of any Server where the Bot is used. The Team does not endorse or take
   responsibility for any actions, content, or interactions that occur within a Server.

2. The Team is not responsible for any issues, conflicts, or disputes that may arise
   between users of the Service within a Server. Users are encouraged to resolve such
   issues independently and in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the
   respective Server.

3. The Team is not responsible for the actions or behavior of any Server administrators,
   moderators, or other staff.

4. The Team may refuse service to the Server if they deem it necessary, following the
   same dispositions outlined in [Section 4](#4-right-to-refuse-service), without any
   repercussions.

## 4. Right to refuse service
1. The Team reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, at any time, for any
   reason, including, but not limited to: violation of these Terms, a misuse of the
   Service, or inappropriate behavior. Any refusal of service will be notified to a
   User through any contact channels available. If there are no contact channels for
   said User, the service will become void immediately, and they will automatically
   waive any rights given to them in the second paragraph of this section. If the
   refusal of service applies to a Server, the Server's owner will be notified, and,
   if possible, a notification will be issued in one of the Server's public channels.
   If this message is at any point deleted by any member of the server with the
   ability to do so, the rights outlined in the second paragraph of this will become
   void from the moment this action is taken.

2. A refusal of service does not require any prior notice or explanation. As a User,
   you have a right to be informed of the reasons for the refusal of Service. To
   exercise this right, [contact the Team](../about.md#contact). You also have a
   right to appeal; that allows you to ask for a review of this case. The Team may
   refuse any of these rights on exceptional occasions if they so see fit, and they
   will automatically become void after forty-eight (48) hours from the notification;
   or if the User or a Server's owner explicitly refuses this right. In this last
   case, not only will the Server owner's rights be revoked, but also those of
   everyone in the Server.

3. If a refusal of service is applied to a user, their access to the Service will be
   fully revoked. Any future usage of the Service, even when carried out by other
   means than the ones originally sanctioned, will be qualified as an immediate
   breach of these Terms. This can be sanctioned as described in Section #TODO

4. If a refusal of service is applied to a Server, the Service will be automatically
   removed from the Server, and access to the Service can be individually refused or
   otherwise revoked to any member of the Server. The second clause applies here, and
   no explanations or reasons will have to be provided by the Team.
