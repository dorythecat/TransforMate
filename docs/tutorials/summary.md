In this page,you have a collection of various tutorials, that try to explain how
to properly use the TransforMate bot in an easy-to-comprehend and interactive
manner, so that it is accessible to everyone.

These tutorials contain small exercises for you to do as you go, if you'd like to
figure stuff out slowly and by yourself. The solution is included so that you can
get the information outright if you so desire, but we recommend "fooling around"
with the bot. You will learn more, faster, and better that way. Give it a try!
