## The story of TransforMate
> TL;DR: TransforMate is just a silly joke project that completely outgrew its
> original scope.

It started quite a while ago, when one of my friends, Ren, introduced me to the
awesome BPTBot, made by the awesome Leroco. It was a really cool bot, but it had a
lot of faults. It was (and still is) closed source too, which, whilst perfectly
understandable, frustrated me.  I love open source. I like being able to fix stuff
when I find it's wrong, or to help improve things, add features, or even just
investigate the code to learn how stuff works. I have always thought that code,
whenever possible, should be free and open, because that means it won't die when
the creators decide they no longer want to support it.

If BPTBot had been open source, or if Leroco hadn't temporarily walked away from the
project, I'd probably never have made TransforMate. Because, in truth, that's what
this bot is. An "I can do it better" joke taken to a practical extreme.

So, with some help from Ren, and some art from another friend, Zen, we made the
base of TransforMate. It was buggy. It was inefficient. It was not versatile. It
lacked a lot of features BPTBot had (and still does to this day), but it was *fun*.
I even got Leroco to wake up and continue developing BPTBot. And it's shaping to be
a seriously cool bot, which I wholeheartedly recommend you go check out if you even
slightly enjoy using TransforMate. It's a much more stable and functional bot, though
it is closed source, and lacks some TransforMate features too. But that's fine! I
love the healthy competition we have developed and what we both have learnt and
improved from it! Kudos to Leroco!

I truly enjoyed developing TransforMate, and it was a great experience. But life
went on, and I discontinued TransforMate for a good while. At the start of the summer
of 2025, though, I tried to revive the project. And god did it revive. Thanks to
some awesome people, like Gwen, Dux, Clodinator, CatoCat, and the great community we
have been steadily building together, I have been able to take TransforMate to a new
extreme.

I will forever be thankful for our community, my Patreon supporters, and all the
awesome people who help keep this project up and running. Without them, I probably
would have taken this bot down a long time ago. Thanks for your support, guys.
Love y'all! <3
