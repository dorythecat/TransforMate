It was a really cool bot, but it had a lot of faults. It was (and still is) closed source too, which, whilst perfectly understandable, frustrated me.  I love open source. I like being able to fix stuff when I find it's wrong, or to help improve things, add features, or even just investigate the code to learn how stuff works. I have always thought that code, whenever possible, should be free and open, because that means it won't die when the creators decide they no longer want to support it.</p> <p>If BPTBot had been open source, or if Leroco hadn't temporarily walked away from the project, I'd probably never have made TransforMate. Because, in truth, that's what this bot is. An \"I can do it better\" joke taken to a practical extreme.</p> <p>So, with some help from Ren, and some art from another friend, Zen, we made the base of TransforMate. It was buggy. It was inefficient. It was not versatile. It lacked a lot of features BPTBot had (and still does to this day), but it was fun. I even got Leroco to wake up and continue developing BPTBot. And it's shaping to be a seriously cool bot, which I wholeheartedly recommend you go check out if you even slightly enjoy using TransforMate. It's a much more stable and functional bot, though it is closed source, and lacks some TransforMate features too. But that's fine! I love the healthy competition we have developed and what we both have learnt and improved from it! Kudos to Leroco!</p> <p>I truly enjoyed developing TransforMate, and it was a great experience. But life went on, and I discontinued TransforMate for a good while. At the start of the summer of 2025, though, I tried to revive the project. And god did it revive. Thanks to some awesome people, like Gwen, Dux, Clodinator, CatoCat, and the great community we have been steadily building together, I have been able to take TransforMate to a new extreme.</p> <p>I will forever be thankful for our community, my Patreon supporters, and all the awesome people who help keep this project up and running. Without them, I probably would have taken this bot down a long time ago. Thanks for your support, guys. Love y'all! &lt;3</p>"},{"location":"about/#how-can-i-help","title":"How can I help?","text":"<p>TransforMate is mostly a passion project. Development, documenting, hosting, and maintenance, all fall under me at the moment.

You can do so over at my Patreon, which also gives you some extra perks, like early access to some of my written works, as well as priority feature requests.</p> <p>If you don't want, or can't help monetarily, it's competely fine. You can help the bot as easy as sharing it with friends, being active in the community, reporting bugs and bad actors, and suggesting new features.</p> <p>If you have any kind of code-related knowledge, I'm always thankful for some help with the coding part of the bot. It's always great to have some other folks having a look around and helping improve the code this little project is made up of.</p> <p>If you have any other ideas on how to help, like wanting to contribute with the community, infrastructure, or other aspects of the bot, please feel free to contact me, I'm always open to new ideas and helping hands!</p>"},{"location":"about/#contact","title":"Contact","text":"<p>The general and recommended way of contacting us is by joining our awesome community in the Official TransforMate Discord Server, where you can talk directly with our community and trained staff.</p> <p>If you're unable to join the server, or would prefer a more private environment, feel free to message me, the developer, on Discord, where I'm known as \"dorythecat\".</p> <p>At the moment, we don't have any more forms of contact available.

If you need to find such a place, you can always use the <code>public-bot-tests</code> channel in the awesome Official TransforMate Discord Server, where you can also freely ask for help to our great team if you get stuck at any point of this guide.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Remember that Discord provides an autocomplete feature, and that, when inputting the command, you can select the field you want to fill out through this very autocomplete feature. When you're still learning, autocomplete will be your very best friend.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/basic/#learning-to-use-the-transform-command","title":"Learning to use the <code>/transform</code> command","text":"<p>This command will be your most versatile tool, since you will constantly be using it, alongside its partner, the <code>/goback</code> command. In this section, you'll learn to transform yourself, but remember you can always change other users by using the <code>user</code> parameter.</p> <p>Go to your testing channel, and type the <code>/transform</code> command. You will see a lot of options, but the one that interests us at this moment is the <code>into</code> parameter. For this test, set it to whatever you like, for example, \"Test1\"; and send the command.</p> <p>And that's it! You have transformed yourself! Try typing in the chat, and see how you're now transformed!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You will easily be able to tell that your avatar when transformed is your normal user avatar. That's because we haven't provided an <code>image_url</code> field, so the bot has defaulted to your profile picture for your avatar.</p> <p>Now that you're transformed, you have to know how to go back, don't you? Try executing the <code>/goback</code> command, without filling out any of the arguments. Ta-dah! Now you're back to normal! Wasn't that easy?</p> <p>Once you're back to normal, if you want to return to your previous form, you just need to send the <code>/goback</code> command once more, and the bot will turn you into whatever you were last time you went back to normal!</p> Exercise 1 <p>You have now transformed yourself for the first time. But, as we've seen, if we don't provide an <code>image_url</code> parameter, we default to just having our profile picture as our avatar. How can we change this by using the <code>\u00ecmage_url</code> parameter?</p> Answer 1 <p>The <code>image_url</code> parameter takes as input any URL that serves an image. This means we could use any image, in theory. To do so, paste it into a Discord channel, right-click on it, and select \"Copy Image URL\". This URL can then be given as the <code>image_url</code> parameter for your transformation. Voil\u00e0! We have an avatar image that isn't your profile picture!</p> <p>But, is there an easier method, that doesn't require us to fool around and paste images into Discord...?</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/basic/#the-simplified-command","title":"The \"simplified\" command","text":"<p>The full <code>/transform</code> command is designed to be very versatile and compact, but it can sometimes be very bothersome having to copy image URLs, or to remember what each option does.</p> <p>This is why the \"simplified\" mode exists! Simply execute <code>/transform</code>, without any parameters (unless you want to transform another user, in which case you should populate the <code>user</code> parameter), and wait for the bot to respond.</p> <p>The bot will ask you what you want to transform into. Now, you can simply reply with the name of what you want to transform into, BUT, and this is where the magic happens; if you attach an image to the message, the bot will automatically set it as your avatar! No need for pesky URLs!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/basic/#playing-with-settings","title":"Playing with settings","text":"<p>There are a lot of settings you can configure for a transformation with TransforMate. If you want to know all of the settings you can configure, check out the set and clear commands index.</p> <p>For the examples given here, we've decided to use the censor, muffle, hush, and stutter settings, which describe the types of settings the bot has available in a pretty good manner, without exceeding what's realistically possible to easily learn in this tutorial.</p> <p>Let's start by the easiest kind of setting: On-off settings. Currently, these are the big, small, hush, and backwards settings. Try and hush your messages by using <code>/set hush</code>. When you type next time, it will be a spoiler, \"hushing\" you. Try it!</p> Exercise 2 <p>Can you make your text small, and disable hushing now?</p> Answer 2 <p>To make your text small, you just need to use the <code>/set small</code> command, and, to stop being hushed, just use <code>/clear hush</code>!</p> <p>That is the most basic type of setting you can modify, but we still have a long way to go! Let's try with numeric settings now! At the moment, the only setting of this kind that's available in TransforMate is he stutter setting. Let's try and make you stutter with a 20% chance. For this, you'll need to use the <code>/set stutter &lt;chance&gt;</code> command. Can you manage to do it?</p> <p>Once you've figured it out, try typing a bit of text and see if you stutter a bit!</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Remember, any time you want to check your current settings you can use <code>/get settings</code>, and the other <code>/get</code> commands to see your settings in detail!</p> <p>You're doing great! We're halfway there to learn all the kinds of modifiers you can use with TransforMate, and being able to transform yourself and others with ease!</p> <p>Now, it's time to introduce chance-based modifiers. These can have a lot of different values for the same user. Let's say, for example, that we have a user, lets call him John. John has been muffled by his friends, with three different words. This means those three words will be substituting some of his words with a random chance.</p> <p>For this example, let's say the words are \"cheese\", \"squeak\", and \"great beyond\", and that their chances to occur are, in order, 20%, 50%, and 3%. How would you se this up?</p> <p>Well, to do so, we would need three commands:</p> <pre><code>/set muffle chese 20\n/set muffle *squeak* 50\n/set muffle \"great beyond\" 3\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <p>You should be aware that a multi-word parameter like \"great beyond\" works because Discord treats everything you write inside a parameter like a single thing, so, in practice, you don't need the surrounding quotes, used here to tell you that it goes al together in the same parameter. If you keep the quotes, they will become part of the final substitution!</p> <p>Now, you might have noticed that we have messed up the word \"cheese\" and written \"chese\" instead! We could always do <code>/clear muffle</code>, to clear all of the muffle settings we have just set up, but, specially for more complex transformations, that is a chore we shouldn't really have to go through!</p> <p>Instead, try using <code>/clear muffle chese</code>! This will only delete the erroneous muffle, and you'll write half as much! Try it!</p> <p>Now, you have learnt the three \"basic\" types of modifiers, and you can use what is basically the entire set of modifiers the bot has to offer. The only two you have left to learn are the biography, and the censor modifiers!</p> Exercise 3 <p>Can you set a biography for your current transformation? Try to be creative!</p> Answer 3 <p>Using the <code>/set bio</code> command you can see a biography as long as you want (Discord's message length restrictions apply).</p> <p>And an exra trick: You can use the <code>\\n</code> escape character to make a line jump!</p> <p>Now, the censor command isn't all that different from the chance-based modifiers like muffle, but it differs in a very important aspect. Censors differ from these in that they don't trigger based on a random chance, but based on a keyword.</p> <p>For example, let's say we censor the word \"four\" to say \"five\". This means that EVERY TIME the transformed user says the word \"four\", they will say \"five\" instead, for example, \"two plus two is four\" will become \"two plus two is five\".</p> <p>To set a censor, we use a similar syntax as for chance-based modifiers. For the above example, for example, we'd use <code>/set censor four five</code>. See? Easy right? Try it out!</p> <p>Now what?</p> <p>You have learnt how to use the basics of modifiers! Now you should try other modifiers around, like the sprinkle or suffix. Try the alternative muffle, that muffles entire messages instead of words, if you want! You're free to experiment with the bot and learn from that! Have fun!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/basic/#exporting-and-importing-transformations","title":"Exporting and importing transformations","text":"<p>Sometimes, you make a really great transformation, and you'd like to either share it with your friends; or just to save it for later whilst you experiment with some new transformation ideas.</p> <p>To do this, you can export and import transformations to either text files; or easy to share (and edit) strings. This not only allows you to save and share transformation, but also to edit transformation data without needing to use a single command for every single thing you want to change about a transformation. To know more about how to edit these files, check out the full documentation for the transformation data string commands, where you'll find a full explanation oh how these strings (and the files) work, so you can edit them to your liking.</p> <p>For now, in this tutorial, we will learn the basics on how to import and export your transformation data. For this, you'll need to be transformed. Choose a form that has a few modifiers applied, so that you can see how they're kept completely through exporting and re-importing it.</p> <p>Now, execute he <code>/export_tf</code> command. You will get a file, with the same name as your transformation. This file contains all the information about your current transformation, that can be used to transform yourself once again, or to transform others.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Transformation files do not store any information about the user that created them, the time they were created at, where they were created at, or how they were created. If no external information is given, transformation files are effectively untraceable, so you don't have to worry about people doxxing you from a transformation file, don't worry!</p> <p>Now, why don't you try transforming into something else? Make sure it's different from what you just transformed out of, but don't worry about making a complex transformation, just enough to see the difference.</p> <p>Now, use the <code>/import_tf</code> command. The bot will ask you for a transformation to use to transform you. You can use a file or a string here. Since we got a file, just send a message with the file attached. And... That's it! Now, if you check your settings, you'll see that you're on the form you were before, all the same! Pretty awesome, right?</p> <p>You can store these files in Discord itself, or on any other storage platform, including your own computer! But not everyone has access to a computer, much less at all times, so, to make storing transformation easier, you can always get a string by setting the <code>file</code> parameter of <code>/export_tf</code> to false! This will give you an easy-to-copy string that you can save in your notes app or in a Discord channel, so it's easier to copy and use!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/basic/#claiming-and-eternally-transforming-other-users","title":"Claiming and eternally transforming other users","text":"<p>For this part of the tutorial, you will need a good friend to be your test subject. Be sure they're fine with being claimed and eternally transformed for a few minutes so you can learn the basics of these features.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Remember, kids: Consent is important</p> <p>Now, transform your friend into something they enjoy being. Once you're done, use the <code>/claim</code> command to claim them. If you do so successfully, the bot will let you know. Now, you're the \"owner\" of your friend. This means you're the only one allowed to transform them and modify their settings. They themselves can still go back to their normal form, though.</p> <p>Danger</p> <p>If at any point you feel uncomfortable as the claimed user, there's a command to free yourself: <code>/safeword</code>. If you feel like your partner has abused you or didn't consent, try to resolve the issue with the server's moderation team. If this doesn't work, use the <code>/report</code> command, or send the word \"report\" to the bot's DMs.</p> <p>To avoid them escaping their transformative cage, you'll have to close the door with the <code>/set eternal</code> command. Now, they'll be eternally transformed into whatever form you have chosen for them, until you decide to free them.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Remember to use <code>/clear eternal</code> and/or <code>/unclaim</code> when you are done with your partner, so they can be free once again.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/basic/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Well, you have done great!

Merging is the same concept, but you'll become literally the same; that includes your messages merging, so you cannot even be differentiated from one another!</p> <p>We recommend starting by checking out the Basic TransforMate Tutorial. If you already come from there, you'll probably be thinking \"can't I just do this by exporting my transformation and importing it onto another user, or viceversa?\", and, yeah, you'd be right, you could do that... Why would you, though? Unless you want to edit the file or string, that limits you to only merging, and, besides, you can do all that with just the <code>/transform</code> command.</p> <p>You might have noticed this command has a <code>copy</code> and a <code>merge</code> parameter, right? The <code>copy</code> parameter takes a user as an input, and it will copy the data from that user into whatever user you choose to transform, including yourself. If you set the <code>merge</code> value to be true, you'll merge with them. Easy, isn't it?</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>When you don't merge two users, the way the bot actually handles this is by adding an invisible character to the end of the name on the newly transformed user.</p> <p>This means that, if you want to transform, let's say, three users, you would need to first do the original transformation, then twin that one onto another, and then, twin the one you just twinned into the other user. Otherwise, the second and third users will effectively be merged!</p> <p>But wait! There's an extra feature awaiting you in this command! You can still provide all the other parameters the <code>/transform</code> command takes, like <code>into</code> and <code>image_url</code>, and the bot will automatically change the copied values to reflect your changed data. This allows you to do some cool stuff, like twinning with very slight changes to he newly transformed user. Try it out!</p>"}]}
